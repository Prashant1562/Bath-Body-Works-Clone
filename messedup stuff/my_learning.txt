1..my first messed up index file... i got help from my friend
2..i wrote all the css code in html and when i tried to seperate it and and link that seperated css file to html it didn't worked
3..fontawesome = first copy fontawesome cdn link in link tag and then copy svg code from fontawesom and paste it in html, html code is not much maniputable
4. i am still struggling with advance css and pseudo element selectors also a little in local storage
5. using flex property with grid property is still confusing for me
6. i also learned that first try to copy the layout in divide and conquer.html and when it works paste it in original file
in landing_p1.html while working with data, after doing grid display stuff i got sad.. why its still not working.. it because you also have to set image sizes
i did not memorized the structure of table, also do not know how to style the tables.. i guess i have learned it now
you cannot access local storage element of a different html file live if you are not connected to that file
